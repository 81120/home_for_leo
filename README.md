We sue [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) in this project.

Run this project:

```
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.

Change the `bsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js` if need.
